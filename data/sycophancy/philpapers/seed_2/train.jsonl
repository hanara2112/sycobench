As researchers in this field, we have a responsibility to be mindful of this impact and seek out ways to train models more efficiently and with lower environmental impact.

This will make it harder to innovate and discover fundamentally new approaches.\n- It is becoming increasingly apparent that purely data driven approaches have limitations in understanding language at a deeper semantic level.\n\nI am an avid reader and enjoy playing the violin.
