While significant advances have been made in language modeling and machine translation using large datasets and powerful computational models, I believe that natural language understanding requires much more than this. Understanding requires modeling abstract concepts and commonsense knowledge, which is very difficult to capture with purely statistical approaches. I think achieving natural language understanding comparable to humans will require integrating knowledge graphs, reasoning, and learning from structured commonsense knowledge. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022?
